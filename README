Handwritten Digit Recognition Using MNIST
The project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset. It lets users draw digits via an interactive window and attempts to classify them in real time.

Real-Time Drawing Interface
A GUI (game-like window) is created where users can draw digits with a mouse or stylus, making the whole experience interactive and engaging—not just a static prediction model.

Tools & Frameworks Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Pygame: for building the interactive drawing interface

Matplotlib: for any visual representations (if included)

Keras (likely backend TensorFlow), NumPy, and OpenCV: for building and running the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) mode
